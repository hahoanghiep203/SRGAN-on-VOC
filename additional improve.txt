1. Enhanced Generator Architecture
Incorporate Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDB): Use a more advanced architecture like ESRGAN, which employs RRDB instead of standard VGG blocks for better feature extraction and gradient flow.
Attention Mechanisms: Add self-attention or channel attention modules to focus on critical image regions and improve texture quality.
2. Dataset Augmentation
Data Augmentation: Apply augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, random cropping, and color jittering to increase the dataset's diversity.
Data Preprocess: Random crop instead of Resize image to get LR and HR images so that it can keep good quality image detail.
3. Training Optimizations
Learning Rate Scheduling: Implement a learning rate scheduler (e.g., cosine decay or step decay) to adapt learning rates dynamically during training.
Pre-Training: Extend pre-training of the generator on MSE loss before adversarial training for more stable convergence.
Batch Normalization: Consider using instance normalization or group normalization instead of batch normalization for improved performance on varied datasets.
4. Performance Metrics
Enhanced Metrics: Track LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) in addition to PSNR and SSIM to evaluate perceptual quality more robustly.
Validation: Include a validation phase during training to monitor overfitting and fine-tune hyperparameters.
5. Fine-Tuned Training Strategy
Progressive Growing: Start training with lower resolutions and progressively increase to full resolution for faster and more stable training.
Discriminator Training Frequency: Experiment with training the discriminator more or less frequently relative to the generator.
